# LootPay Project Description

## Исходное описание проекта (Original Project Description)

**Название**: LootPay Telegram Bot

**Цель**: Создать Telegram-бота для безопасного и быстрого пополнения аккаунтов Steam, который поможет пользователям оплачивать внутриигровые покупки через игровую платежную карту или банковскую карту, отслеживать статус транзакций и узнавать текущие курсы валют для перевода средств.

**Основная задача**: Сделать процесс добавления средств на аккаунт Steam максимально простым, прозрачным и выгодным, чтобы геймеры могли легко покупать игры, скины и другие предметы в Steam.
